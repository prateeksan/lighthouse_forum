# Lighthouse Forum

An experimental project to test CRUD functionality on rails by building a simple forum.

## Test it out:

` $ git clone https://github.com/prateeksan/blog.git`

` $ bundle install `

` $ bundle exec rake db:migrate `

` $ rails s `

Open up `localhost:3000` on your browser and you're all set!
